                <h2>A little bit about me.</h2>
                <p>My tech journey started with a degree in journalism. I loved researching, writing, and sharing my voice online, but something felt missing. I wished for a way to share and display information exactly the way I wanted. That's when I discovered and fell in love with coding and web design!</p>
                <p>As a front end developer, I pride myself on writing code that's easy to read and build upon while still looking great. My goal with every site is to provide a top-of-the-line user experience. Besides web development, I enjoy gardening and spending time with my small (but growing!) family.</p>

                    <p>I pride myself on my organized and well-formatted HTML and CSS. All my code is tested to ensure it's valid, accessible for all users, and works great on the major browsers.</p>

                    <p>If you have a design, I can turn it into a website! I'll use the exact colors, fonts, and imagery you need. You provide the design comp, and I'll code up a site just for you.</p>

                    <p>I never work on a project without my best friends Git and GitHub! I can collaborate with your team on any codebase and adjust to your team's version control workflow.</p>
